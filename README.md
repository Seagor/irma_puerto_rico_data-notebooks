# Hurricane Irman Response Data and Notebooks

This repo has datasets from the Puerto Rico GIS portal http://www2.pr.gov/agencias/gis/descargaGeodatos/Pages/default.aspx

The data has been contverted from their native shapefiles EPSG:6566 to geojson EPSG:4326 using ogr2ogr and uploaded to the repo.

We'll be adding DigitalGlobe imagery and Jupyter notebooks as they become available.  DigitalGlobe imagery will also be posted to https://www.digitalglobe.com/opendata as it becomes available.
